            <div class="col-lg-4">
                <p>When choosing my subjects for year 12 at Saint Kentigerns, I found myself at a crossroads. Having
                    already chosen French and Accounting, I was stuck for my third option. My father suggested that I
                    chose Computer Science, as I had ways had a “knack for computers”. Five years on and I am eternally
                    grateful to my father for his input. While my French vocabulary still needs some work and my love
                    for balance sheets never really came to fruition, I discovered a true passion for coding, an
                    interest that I would love to develop into a career.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="col-lg-4">
                <p>Along with this interest in coding, I have long been fascinated by the marketing industry. For this
                    reason, I decided to pursue a conjoint degree of Computer Science and Marketing. After two years of
                    study at Victoria University, I am currently undertaking my third year at Auckland University. Over
                    summer, I took part in a tech internship at Healthlink, a health system integrator that enables
                    medical practices to communicate electronically with the rest of the health sector. This was an eye
                    opening experience that exposed me to the realities of working in the tech industry and really
                    confirmed my desire to pursue a career in this area.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="col-lg-4 ">
                <p>While I am most interested in developing my skills in front-end development, I am curious about all
                    fields of development, and eventually hope to become a full stack developer. I would love to work
                    for a leading tech company in this regard, and a company that values curiosity, passion and a desire
                    to learn. I would relish the opportunity to work with innovative colleagues who think big and tackle
                    challenges from a fresh perspective. My aim is to work in a environment with a highly involved and
                    dynamic working culture, to provide an atmosphere that is conducive to personal growth.

                        <p>

                            Through the New Zealand tech internship program - Summer Of Tech I was lucky enough to be
                            hired as an intern dev at Healthlink over the 2016/2017 summer. This was my first experience
                            working in the tech industry which was really exciting to be involved and learn about all
                            these great technologies that were brand new to me.<br/>
                            <br/>During this internship, I was exposed to many new technologies, such as AngularJS,
                            ReactJS, SwaggerUI, Node.js, NPM, CI/CD (Docker, Rancher) and Jersey. Although I am not an
                            expert in these technologies, I now have a basic understanding of how they work and what
                            they do.<br/>
                            <br/>Healthlink is an Agile workplace, which was amazing to be apart of. The daily
                            stand-ups, sprint reviews, retrospectives, sprint backlog and planning meetings and just
                            being apart of a great team, with an exceptional PO. During my time at Healthlink, I worked
                            with my team to build a search a directory product, which involved getting to learn about
                            the backend with databases and the front-end with APIs and design.

                        <h2>Victoria University</h2>
                        <hr class="star">
                        <p>Whilst attending Victoria University, during the first semester of my second year, I decided
                            to apply to be a tutor for the first level paper for Information Systems. Although not my
                            major, I had an interest in this course and it was a sort-of combination of both my degrees.<br/>
                            <br/>As a tutor, my public speaking skills improved dramatically, as I was in charge of
                            conducting and controlling four classes per week, where I would teach, ask questions, answer
                            questions and guide students in achieving their desired grades for the course.<br/>
                            <br/>Each week, I would mark students’ weekly assignments. This was a time-consuming task
                            due to the large quantity of papers, but overall it was a great experience to be able to
                            teach students, and to be on the other side of university for a change.<br/>

                        <hr class="star">
                        <p>Websites have always been my greatest interest, as I personally find they are quite easy to
                            get engrossed in. I can find myself coding for hours without realising, until I hit a bug
                            which will not fix itself. Having the opportunity to create an online store was very
                            exciting, as I had only created basic static websites before. Looking back on the website
                            now, there are a lot of things I would have done differently to create it more efficiently
                            and more dynamic. This is something I hope to change if I get the chance to do one in the
                            near future.<br/>
                            <br/> With ENA, I met with Nadya, the owner and she gave me a brief and a basic design that
                            she wanted. Given this information, I went away and created a basic store, and over time we
                            worked together to get the perfect design that she wanted. The website was created through
                            Shopify, which was something that I had to learn to use, and work with.<br/>
                            <br/>Overall, I was really happy with the end result, as was Nadya - which was the main
                            thing.<br/>

                        <h2>Twitter Bot</h2>
                        <hr class="star">
                        <p>This TwitterBot is a small project I worked on to develop my skills in Javascript, NodeJS,
                            NPM, APIs and git. Although small, and unlikely to be the "next big thing", it was a great
                            side project to work on to develop my personal skills.<br/>
                            <br/>To begin with, I did some research on creating a TwitterBot and watched a few
                            tutorials. I started off by creating the bot to do a simple task such as tweeting out a
                            random tweet when someone sent the account a tweet. From here, I went through the Yelp API
                            and played around with this to get the information that I needed.<br/>
                            <br/>The next step was the put that information into a tweet to return to the user. This was
                            a bug that was difficult to fix, as there was an issue with returning information from one
                            function to another due to the Yelp API. This took me a while to resolve, but I managed to
                            fix it by finding the information I needed in the first function and bypass needing to call
                            the second one.<br/>
                            <br/>Another challenge that I had to overcome was understanding git. Git is a very useful
                            tool, and I intend to use it with all projects from now on, however the initial learning
                            curve for it was quite steep, and I am still climbing it. There were several times where I
                            lost commits, or pushed or pulled something I shouldn’t have, however, eventually I managed
                            to get my project up and running online, with the help of Git<br/>

                            <br/>What I enjoyed most about creating this application was seeing it live in action, most
                            of the projects I work on are for university papers, and they don't go past the marker's
                            desk. But this project is live and running and it is something that I am quite proud of, no
                            matter how small.<br/>

                    <h2>Auckland Map</h2>
                    <hr class="star">
                    <p>This was the first and my favourite project for the Algorithms and Databases paper I did at
                        Victoria University. This project pushed us into learning about data structures, and creating a
                        fun programme which displays a map of Auckland, with different roads and intersections. This
                        project was done in two parts;<br/><br/>

                    <h4>Part One:</h4>
                    <br/>For part one, we needed to create the basic map, parsing a file document which had Roads, Nodes
                    and Segments. A difficult part in this process was understanding the data that we were giving, and
                    understanding what part was a road, a segment and a node.<br/>
                    We were also to be able to navigate the map, with pan and zoom buttons, and allow the user to drag
                    the map around with the mouse. In Part One, the search function was also created at basic level,
                    where roads could only be searched if the exact street was searched for. I extended this search by
                    making a trie, in which all roads would be highlighted when the name is prefixed by the search
                    input, not just the exact match, however if a search query exactly matches a road name, only that
                    road would be highlighted. This function was very tricky, as it was difficult to distinguish when
                    the search was complete and a specific street needed to be highlighted, rather than all closely
                    matched streets.<br/>
                    We were also to add functionality, where if a user clicked on the map, the node closest to the click
                    would be highlighted. This was tricky due to having to use Pythagoras's Theorem to work out distance
                    from the click, to the nearest node.<br/>
                    <br/>
                    <h4>Part Two:</h4>

                    <br/>A* and Articulation Points were the main focus in the second part. The purpose of using A* was
                    to find the shortest route between two selected intersections. This included taking into
                    consideration one-way streets, accounting for restriction information, and finding the distance and
                    time with the speed information to make the search prefer routes on high class roads and faster
                    routes.
                    <br/> Articulation points were used so that the map could find all nodes that are articulation
                    points, which were to be displayed as a different colours.
                    <br/>Part Two was an easier learning curve, as I had already worked on my code and had created a
                    base for what was to be completed. However the A* work was difficult as the information that needed
                    to be collected was vast and difficult to process.


                    <br/><br/> Overall, I really enjoyed working on the map as it helped me understand a lot of
                    different data structures and algorithms.</p>
